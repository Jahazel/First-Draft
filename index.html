      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        This project presents an AI-powered document reader designed to improve
        access to visual information for blind and low-vision (BLV) users. By
        combining Tesseract OCR with customizable text-to-speech output using
        Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS), our system extracts text from images and
        PDFs and delivers the content audibly through a lightweight web
        interface. The tool is built with accessibility in mind, emphasizing
        screen-reader compatibility, intuitive controls, and real-time feedback.
        Through user testing on various document types, we find that traditional
        OCR alone can provide meaningful access when paired with thoughtful
        interface design and flexible voice output. This work demonstrates how
        readily available technologies can be combined to create more inclusive
        tools for document navigation and comprehension.
      </p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Many existing tools for blind and low-vision (BLV) users rely heavily on
        static image captions or alt text, which often fall short in conveying
        layout, structure, or nuanced visual detail—especially in documents that
        contain complex formatting or embedded images. Low vision refers to a
        visual acuity of less than 6/18 but equal to or better than 3/60 in the
        better eye with best possible correction<sup><a href="#ref9">9</a></sup
        >. This classification underscores the challenges faced by individuals
        who, despite some residual vision, encounter significant difficulties in
        processing visual information. As Nair et al. (2023)<sup
          ><a href="#ref6">6</a></sup
        >
        note, "little work has been done to explore the specific interaction
        bottlenecks faced by BLV users in the image exploration process and
        propose potential solutions" beyond basic descriptions. To address this
        gap, we developed an AI-powered document reader that combines optical
        character recognition (OCR) with customizable text-to-speech features.
        Our system uses
        <a href="https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract" target="_blank"
          >Tesseract OCR</a
        >
        to extract textual content from uploaded images and PDFs, then converts
        the output into spoken audio using Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS).
      </p>
      <p>
        We built an accessible web interface using
        <a href="https://gradio.app/" target="_blank">Gradio</a>, prioritizing
        screen-reader compatibility, intuitive navigation, and user
        customization. Unlike many existing academic examples that emphasize
        model performance, our system focuses on real-world
        usability—particularly for users who rely on auditory output or have
        limited vision.

      <p>
        While it does not aim to solve every accessibility challenge, it
        demonstrates how thoughtful integration of existing technologies can
        empower users to independently navigate visual information. Ultimately,
        we hope this work serves as a foundation for further development of
        adaptive, inclusive systems.
      </p>

      <h2>Ethical Sweep</h2>

      <h3>General Considerations</h3>
      <p>
        At a high level, our work aims to improve accessibility for low-vision
        users by creating an AI-powered document reader that combines OCR and
        text-to-speech with an intuitive, inclusive interface. This tool has the
        potential to meaningfully enhance document comprehension, especially for
        materials that include complex layouts or images, which traditional OCR
        systems often struggle to interpret. However, the benefits hinge on
        careful and ethical implementation, especially regarding fairness,
        accuracy, and user privacy.
      </p>
      <p>
        While non-ML alternatives (e.g., basic OCR paired with text-to-speech)
        exist, they typically fall short in terms of interpreting image-heavy or
        structurally complex documents. Our approach, using OCR combined with
        audio output, is better suited for delivering contextual understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, all files are processed locally and not uploaded to
        external cloud servers. While uploaded files are temporarily stored
        during use, future improvements could include automatic deletion after
        processing to strengthen user privacy protections. We also made design
        choices that keep the system lightweight and customizable, reducing
        dependency on closed or proprietary platforms that might introduce bias
        or limit user control.
      </p>

      <h3>Data Curation and Use</h3>
      <p>
        Our tool relies primarily on the Tesseract OCR engine<sup
          ><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup
        >, which uses pre-trained "Trained Data Files" for general-purpose text
        recognition across a wide variety of languages and layouts. In addition
        to this, we reference the SynthText dataset<sup
          ><a href="#ref6">6</a></sup
        >, which represents a small synthetic fraction of the broader training
        material. Together, these sources offer a strong foundation for printed
        text extraction across different document types. However, they also have
        limitations when it comes to less conventional documents—such as
        handwritten notes, tactile documents like Braille, or highly cluttered
        layouts—which could reduce the effectiveness of our system in certain
        contexts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since our project focuses solely on OCR-based extraction (rather than
        full document layout understanding or image captioning), our main
        sources of potential bias relate to character recognition and language
        coverage. A key concern is that the standard Tesseract-trained models
        and datasets like SynthText are predominantly focused on English and
        Latin-based scripts, meaning users working with other languages or
        writing systems may experience reduced accuracy. Additionally, because
        SynthText is synthetically generated, it may not fully reflect the
        variability, noise, and imperfections found in real-world scanned
        documents, forms, or receipts.
      </p>
      <p>
        These limitations highlight the importance of validating our tool with a
        wider range of real-world documents and expanding language and
        formatting support in future iterations.
      </p>

      <h3>Impact Assessment</h3>
      <p>
        Our main ethical focus is on how the tool might affect users if it were
        actually deployed in real-world settings. One consideration is user
        reliance: even though we’re designing this to support low-vision users,
        we wouldn’t want the system to unintentionally replace or diminish their
        existing strategies for navigating content. To address this, we
        discussed ideas like a “hints” or “progressive reveal” mode that would
        allow users to control the level of assistance they receive. However,
        due to time and project scope, we prioritized building a functional,
        reliable baseline tool first.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another potential issue is how the tool would perform with documents
        involving high-stakes information—such as medical instructions,
        financial records, or legal documents—which require extremely high
        accuracy. We are not aiming for full reliability in these contexts at
        this stage. In future versions, we could imagine adding features like
        automatic confidence scoring, accuracy warnings, or prompts to verify
        critical information with a sighted assistant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, we recognize that the current system may not perform equally
        well across all document types—especially handwritten notes, complex
        diagrams, or non-English content. More testing and direct feedback from
        real-world users would be essential to understand these gaps. Long-term,
        it will be important to track how improvements impact different user
        groups to avoid unintentionally favoring certain types of documents or
        users over others.
      </p>

      <h2>Related Work</h2>
      <p>
        Several previous efforts have informed and shaped our project, yet each
        contains gaps that our solution specifically targets and resolves. For
        example, Smith's ImageAssist (2021)<sup><a href="#ref5">5</a></sup>
        enabled visually impaired users to explore document images through a
        screen reader-accessible interface with gesture-based region
        highlighting. However, it focused primarily on isolated, exploratory
        interactions rather than integrated interpretation of mixed
        textual-visual content. Our application explicitly advances beyond this
        by providing cohesive, contextually integrated descriptions for entire
        documents, thus filling a crucial accessibility gap left by ImageAssist.
      </p>
      <p>
        Vijayanarayanan et al. (2023)<sup><a href="#ref6">6</a></sup> combined
        optical character recognition (OCR) with text-to-speech to help users
        extract printed text from digital images. While their approach
        highlighted OCR’s strengths in parsing clear, structured text, it
        overlooked the interpretation of complex visual elements and irregular
        document layouts. Our project directly addresses this limitation by
        integrating HuggingFace transformer models optimized for image
        captioning and layout comprehension, ensuring that textual and visual
        elements are both included in the document’s accessible description.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bodi et al. (2021)<sup><a href="#ref7">7</a></sup> developed tools like
        NarrationBot and InfoBot to generate real-time contextual audio
        descriptions for dynamic media (e.g., video), helping blind users
        understand changes in visual scenes. However, their work remains focused
        on dynamic environments, leaving static, document-based interactions
        underexplored. Our solution adapts those principles of multimodal
        narration to static content, specifically targeting documents that
        combine text and embedded imagery.
      </p>
      <p>
        Collectively, our project synthesizes these foundational insights while
        explicitly resolving their individual limitations, delivering a uniquely
        comprehensive, robust accessibility solution tailored precisely to the
        critical needs of low-vision users interpreting complex visual-textual
        documents.
      </p>

      <h2>Methods</h2>
      <p>
        Our goal was to build a system that could interpret both textual and
        visual content in documents through the integration of optical character
        recognition (OCR) and transformer-based vision-language models (VLMs).
        To ensure a user-friendly and accessible interface, we also incorporated
        real-time interaction features using popular Python web frameworks.
        Below, we detail the specific tools, models, datasets, and technical
        strategies that powered our system.
      </p>
      <p>
        To extract text from images and PDFs, we selected Tesseract OCR<sup
          ><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup
        >
        due to its open-source accessibility and extensive community validation
        across various fonts and languages. Tesseract is particularly effective
        in converting scanned or image-based text into digital content, which is
        critical for users who depend on screen readers or text-to-speech
        technology. The OCR pipeline in Tesseract includes several preprocessing
        stages such as layout analysis, line segmentation, and blob detection.
        After segmenting the text into lines and characters, the system proceeds
        through a two-pass recognition process. In the first pass, it generates
        hypotheses for character sequences based on grouping and shape
        similarity. These preliminary results are then used to train a temporary
        classifier that reprocesses the text in the second pass, leading to
        improved accuracy—especially for noisy or ambiguous input.
      </p>
      <p>
        A major advantage of Tesseract lies in its integration of deep learning
        techniques. As of version 4.0, Tesseract incorporates Long Short-Term
        Memory (LSTM) networks, which are a type of Recurrent Neural Network
        (RNN) capable of modeling sequential dependencies. LSTMs are
        particularly useful in OCR tasks as they can maintain memory across
        longer spans of text, making them ideal for handling paragraph-level
        content with inconsistent formatting or irregular character placement.
        The internal architecture of an LSTM cell is designed around three
        primary gates—forget, input, and output—that control the flow of
        information through the cell. These gates use nonlinearities such as the
        sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent functions to regulate memory updates and
        output generation.

      <p>
        The integration of these models was managed through an interactive web
        interface, which we developed using
        <a href="https://www.gradio.app/" target="_blank">Gradio</a
        ><sup><a href="#ref3">3</a></sup
        >. Gradio allowed for quick prototyping and flexible interface creation
        using Blocks, making it an ideal choice for accessibility-focused
        design. The resulting web application allows users to upload documents
        or images, processes them through the OCR pipeline, and outputs
        structured textual descriptions that can be read aloud using a
        text-to-speech module.
      </p>

      <p><b>INSERT FULL SYSTEM PIPELINE DIAGRAM HERE</b></p>

      <p>
        To understand our models and measure the system’s effectiveness, we used 
        the pre-trained  data from the SynthText dataset<sup><a href="#ref6">6</a></sup> as well
        as Tesseract’s own training corpus. The SynthText dataset contains over
        800,000 synthetic text images that simulate real-world distortions,
        including varied backgrounds, fonts, and orientations. To test the 
        system’s performance, we simply 
        conducted manual reviews to ensure contextual relevance
        and clarity in the captions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since we relied entirely on pre-trained models and
         built-in pipelines provided by the software, no new measurements,
          model training, post-processing, or audio adjustments were performed.
           The OCR outputs, image captions, and audio were generated and cleaned
          through the system’s own internal processes. Our work focused on utilizing
           these existing outputs to support user needs without additional 
           modification.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although we have not yet conducted formal
        user testing, in the future, we plan to incorporate feedback mechanisms within the
        application. Users will be able to flag incorrect outputs, and these
        reports will help us prioritize improvements in future versions. Our
        goal is to ensure that the system continues to evolve based on
        real-world needs, particularly those of the low-vision community.

        OCR<sup><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup
        >, and receive audio playback using Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS). Users
        can also select from different English voice types, including Female US,
        Female AU, and UK English. The system was tested using a range of
        document types, including clean text, text with visual noise, and longer
        passages.

        Each of these inputs generated an MP3 file stored in the
        <code>outputs/</code> folder, confirming successful audio synthesis.
        These audio files are named based on the uploaded filename and the
        selected voice, e.g., <code>sample_female_us.mp3</code>. A screenshot of
        the output directory (shown below) verifies the system's ability to
        generate multiple outputs across testing sessions.

        The frontend was built with Gradio’s Blocks API, which provided
        flexibility in creating a modular interface. Features include a file
        upload component, voice type dropdown, audio preview, text display of
        processing status, and a download button for offline access to generated
        speech. The UI was further customized with CSS to improve readability
        and accessibility for users with low vision.

        From the backend, the system successfully handled both
        <code>.jpg</code>/<code>.png</code> image inputs and
        <code>.pdf</code> documents. PDF processing was handled by
        <code>pdf2image</code>, converting pages into images before passing them
        to Tesseract. Text was then sent to gTTS for synthesis using the
        selected language and accent. Voice customization was achieved using the
        <code>tld</code> parameter in gTTS, allowing regional variations like US
        (.com), UK (.co.uk), and Australia (.com.au).
      </p>

      <p>
        The extracted audio was clear and accurate for all clean inputs. As
        expected, performance degraded slightly with visually noisy inputs,
        reinforcing one of the known limitations of OCR models like Tesseract
        when faced with cluttered backgrounds or poor contrast. This finding
        supports the need for preprocessing techniques or fallback strategies in
        future versions of the tool.
